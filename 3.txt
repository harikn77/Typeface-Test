Data store to save monitoring data of service 
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------


We will build a library function that measure the clock time at api request and api response , we store the time difference

uuid - automatic generated prinmary key
response_time - time difference
api_id - each api will have an id 
user_id - each user would have a unique id
timestamp_start - when api hit
timestamp_end - when api send back response
error - yes/no
we store these details in a table in Data_Store


max avg response time - 
for each api_id group by api_id and then select maximum and then do avg in the query



get max avg response time for each user -
for each user_id group by user_id find maximum of each api_id then do avg on them to get for each user



get error percentage -
for each api_id do a filter of last 24 hrs and for each hour do percentage by calculating sum of errors divided by total
